    "Here we can see the drastic change in the structure of higher education between roughly 1960 and 1975 that I mentioned above: There's an explosion in the number of PhDs coming from small universities. Until 1960 or so Oxford, Cambridge and Edinburgh produced 70-80% of PhDs in the country. By 1980 it was around 20%, and has stayed roughly constant since. They remain the largest PhD factories, but the field has been filled with dozens of smaller institutions. During the shift many new universities were founded (Sussex 1961, York 1963, Warwick 1965, ...), many others expanded greatly, and various colleges and other educational institutions were turned into universities. I'm not a historian, but for some background and context, check Wikipedia on for instance [University Grant Comission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Grants_Committee_(United_Kingdom)), [Robbins Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_Report), and [Education Act of 1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Act_1962). I was previously aware that there was an expansion of higher education in many Western countries around this time, but the magnitude and speed of the shift in the above plot surprised me.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some interesting individual stories in this same plot. Oxford used to dominate its rival Cambridge with a doctoral output several times larger until the late 60s, after which the two have been roughly equal. Even Oxford was for a time ecplised by Edinburgh though, which in some years produced more than 40% of all PhDs in the UK. The historical importance of Scotland was further bolstered by Aberdeen, which used to be one of the major players until the 60s, but is now just another mid-sized entry. (It should be said though that I suspect that these early years may suffer from a significant number of missing theses, that may skew the data to some degree. The main qualitative statement probably still stands though.) Imperial has an interesting bulge of activity during the 1960s as it went through [a rapid expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London#20th_century), a bit before many others followed suit."

They typically aren't full sentences and their grammatical forms vary wildly, which makes analysis of their linguistic structure tricky and, I would guess, in many cases a bit futile. Unlike with more structured text, almost as much information as in the title itself is contained in just a list of words appearing in the title. Lists of words are also easy to analyse, so we'll go with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we strip the titles of any punctation and so called stop words like articles and prepositions that don't tell us much, and make everything lower case. We could also do what's called stemming, and collapse for instance \"study\", \"studies\", \"studied\" and \"studying\" all into a single word. I choose not to do this because as we'll see below, different inflections of the same stem word sometimes appear in significantly different kinds of titles. Moreover, with academic vocabulary, doing this properly isn't straight-forward: the stemming algorithm should for instance know to combine \"phenomenon\" and \"phenomena\", but perhaps not \"phenomenal\" or \"phenomenology\", and certainly not \"phenolic\". A quick experiment that I did with one stemmer also suggested that the following results wouldn't be greatly affected.\n",

There's several different ways we could normalize the weights. Dividing by the total appearance counts of the words (diagonal of the adjacency matrix) would make the weight of the edge between nodes A and B represent a conditional probability (or rather a frequency) P(A|B) of word A appearing in a title given that word B appears. We could also make a bidirectional graph that has both P(A|B) and P(B|A) stored for each edge. Or we could do a number of more symmetric normalizations that don't have as concrete an interpretation. A choice that I've found works well for what I want to do with this graph later is normalizing the edge between A and B by average of the frequencies of A and B. This is symmetric (the graph is undirected) and roughly speaking gives a large weight for edges that connect two words that appear roughly equally frequently and often together."

We use below one quite well-known one, the [Louvain algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0476), which is a heuristic algorithm based on optimizing the modularity of the graph, i.e. minimizing the weight of edges connecting different communities and maximizing the weight of edges internal to communities. I tried a few other methods as well, most notably label-propagation and stochastic block models, but at least with the parameters that I tried they seemed to produce communities that were either very small or did not match well my human intuition of which words I would expect to be related."

I've been running the same community finding on graphs made with only subsets of the data set, leaving out some of the theses, and also tried including more or less words in the co-occurrence graph (remember we picked the arbitrary cutoff of only including words with at least 10 occurrences). The main communities fortunately appear quite stable under such perturbations. Including some what less words or less theses sometimes makes Humanities merge with Social sciences, but otherwise the communities stay roughly as they are. Going the other way, including more rare words in the graph may for instance sometimes cause particle physics to separate from the rest of Science. These kinds of granularity differences, of whether a field splits into a further subfields or merges with its academic neighbour, is quite natural, and doesn't in my view undermine the analysis in any significant way."

    "Next, what we would like to do is assign to each word and thesis title a score or label, that would tell us roughly which field(s) it belongs in. The naive way would be to just use to label each word with its respective community, and count how many humanities words appear in a given title, etc. This doesn't seem quite fair though. Clearly some words are in some sense more \"deeply\" in each community. For instance the word \"theory\" gets grouped into social sciences, but obviously it occurs in other contexts as well, unlike the word \"policy\", which is pretty dead giveaway. To account for this effect, we'll give each word a score for how strongly they are connected to each community. This score starts out being 1 for the community the word belongs in and 0 for the others, but we add to it the total weight of edges connecting this word to words in a given community. So a word that is in the Humanities community and co-occurs mostly with other Humanities words gets a high Humanities-score, whereas a word that co-occurs with words from several different communities will have significant scores for all of them. Finally, we'll normalize the scores by the total sum within a field, so for instance the Social score of each word will be divided by the sum of Social scores of all words. This accounts for the fact that some fields include more words, and these words may be more strongly connected in our co-occurrence graph. We'll also multiply the resulting scores by 10,000, just to produce more human-readable numbers."

    "Here on the diagonal are histograms showing the how many theses get which score, for each of the fields. Above the diagonal, the single numbers shown there are correlation coefficients between the field scores. For instance since the second row of plots is for Science and the fourth column is for Humanities, the number at their intersection, around -0.5, is the correlation coefficient between Science and Humanities scores. Mirroring these correlations, below the diagonal we have 2D histograms showing the distribution of theses for each pair of two fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking first at the 1D histograms on the diagonal, note that the first peak in each of them is not the interesting part. Since we smudged the boundaries of fields by adding neighbouring edge weights when scoring words, most words have a non-zero score for all the fields. The first peaks then represent a sort of baseline value, of what's a usual score for a thesis that isn't really in the given field. The interesting bits are the fat tails, the bulges, around scores of 2 and more. They represent the theses that scores unusually high for a given field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next observation is that the distributions for different fields are very different. This is natural, given that some (e.g. Eco/Geo) are much more specific than others (e.g. Science). This does mean though that, despite our best attempts to normalize the scores meaningfully, we probably shouldn't assign much meaning to statements like \"this thesis has a much higher Humanities than Social score\", but rather concentrate on correlations and trends that are independent of the overall scale of the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlations tell us a lot about how distinct the different fields are. The highest positive correlation is between Humanities and Social sciences, which isn't very surprising, and goes together with my observation that sometimes the two fields fuse in the community finding analysis if a smaller data set is used. They both are heavily anti-correlated with Science and Biomed, again matching intuitive expectation. The one thing that somewhat surprises me is that Science, Biomed, and Eco/Geo are virtually independent of each other: I would have guessed topics like chemistry and population biology to cause some mixing between them. This is good though, since it makes the 5-way scoring more meaningful, when the scores aren't predictable from each other. The 2D histograms below the diagonal provide a more detailed visual picture of what is summarised by the correlation coefficients."

    "I've chosen to smooth the curves out a bit by doing a Gaussian rolling average of the data over time. Since there aren't that many theses coming out from a single institution in a single year the plots would look quite noisy and hard to read otherwise.\n",

    "Hardly surprisingly, London School of Economics is heavily leaning towards humanities and social sciences, and consistently puts out PhD theses that score higher in those fields than other universities. Less obviously, the above plot also provides evidence for the often-heard view that of the Oxbridge two, Cambridge is the more science heavy one, whereas Oxford leans towards humanities and social sciences. Imperial lives up to its reputation of being a science school first and foremost. Less expected is its huge growth in Biomed in the 90s and early 2000s, but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London#20th_century) informs me that this is probably due to mergers with several medical institutions around that time."
